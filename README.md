Tut04
=====

April 2014


"Tut04" is a tutorial HaxePunk file used at a presentation (2013, Universidad Autonoma de Chile) to show how to code cross-platform applications using OpenFL/Haxe.

To build, make sure that OpenFL, Haxe and HaxePunk are correctly installed and run:

$ lime build <platform>

i.e. 

$ lime build linux
$ lime build windows
$ lime build android

For Android build, a functional SDK/NDK must be working before.

Any comments, direct them to <jci at codemonkey.cl>

No license involved on this code. There's a sprite (Mario, from Nintendo) that will be removed soon enough.
